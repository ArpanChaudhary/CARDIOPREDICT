### **1. Clinical Symptoms**  
These symptoms indicate possible heart issues:
- **Chest Pain (Angina)** – Discomfort or pain in the chest, pressure, squeezing, or fullness.
- **Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea)** – Difficulty in breathing, especially during exertion or rest.
- **Fatigue** – Persistent tiredness or weakness.
- **Palpitations** – Irregular heartbeat or a feeling of rapid, fluttering, or pounding heart.
- **Dizziness or Lightheadedness** – Feeling faint or unsteady.
- **Swelling (Edema)** – Swelling in legs, feet, ankles, or abdomen due to fluid retention.
- **Nausea or Vomiting** – Especially in women, it can be a sign of heart disease.
- **Cold Sweats** – Unexplained sweating, especially at night.
- **Pain in Jaw, Neck, or Back** – Common in women experiencing heart disease.
- **Left Arm Pain** – Radiating pain from the chest to the left arm.

### **2. Physiological and Medical Indicators**
These measurable health parameters help in cardiovascular disease prediction:
- **Blood Pressure (BP)**
  - High systolic BP (above 140 mmHg)
  - High diastolic BP (above 90 mmHg)
- **Cholesterol Levels**  
  - High LDL (bad cholesterol)  
  - Low HDL (good cholesterol)  
  - High total cholesterol  
- **Glucose Levels**  
  - Fasting blood sugar (≥126 mg/dL)  
  - HbA1c (≥6.5%) – Indicator of diabetes risk  
- **Heart Rate (Pulse Rate)**
  - Normal: 60-100 bpm  
  - Tachycardia (above 100 bpm)  
  - Bradycardia (below 60 bpm)  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
  - Overweight (BMI ≥25)
  - Obese (BMI ≥30)  
- **Waist-to-Hip Ratio**  
  - High ratio indicates obesity-related cardiovascular risk.  
- **Triglyceride Levels**  
  - High triglycerides increase heart disease risk.  
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**
  - A marker of inflammation linked to heart disease.

### **3. Lifestyle and Behavioral Risk Factors**
These factors increase the risk of cardiovascular disease:
- **Smoking** – Active and passive smoking increase heart disease risk.
- **Alcohol Consumption** – Excessive alcohol can raise blood pressure.
- **Physical Inactivity** – Lack of exercise increases heart risk.
- **Dietary Habits**  
  - High salt intake  
  - High saturated/trans fats  
  - Low fiber and vegetable intake  
- **Sleep Patterns**  
  - Less than 6 hours or poor-quality sleep.
- **Stress and Anxiety** – Psychological stress can contribute to hypertension.
- **Work Hours Per Week** – Prolonged work stress may impact cardiovascular health.

### **4. Genetic and Family History**
- **Family History of Cardiovascular Disease** – If parents or siblings have had heart issues.
- **Genetic Disorders** – Conditions like familial hypercholesterolemia.
- **History of Stroke or Heart Attack** – Previous cardiovascular events increase risk.

### **5. Additional Risk Conditions**
- **Diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2)** – Increased sugar levels damage arteries.
- **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)** – Persistent high BP can damage arteries.
- **Chronic Kidney Disease** – Poor kidney function is linked to heart disease.
- **Thyroid Disorders** – Hypothyroidism can increase cholesterol levels.
- **Anemia** – Insufficient oxygen supply affects heart function.
- **Autoimmune Disorders (e.g., Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis)** – Inflammation affects blood vessels.
- **Metabolic Syndrome** – A combination of obesity, high BP, and high sugar levels.
